vertical scalaility - increasing resouces in single machine to handle work
horizontal scalaility  - adding machines in order to handle work

how to load json file in hadoop


Mapreduce:-
data ->processing->report generator


monitoring and scheduling tools - oozie

cloudera,ibm,hotornwoks,microsoft-  gives hadoop with packaging and adding extra features
eg ,. we dont consume tea directy we addd some featurees and then consumes it

block size in linux ,windows and hadoop

task tracker and datanode will on same physical machine

job tracker lies on namenode or outside

hadoop cluster = collection of racks
racks = namenodes,jobtracker,datanodes,task tracker


data center = is plce where racks or cluster are kept



Primitive Data type-



primitive data type              wrapper class         Hadoop
									mutable             immutable 
int          						 integer             IntWritable 
byte         						 Byte                Byte writable   
char         						 character           character



sort implement coparable class internally


when we dont have key then we will pass adress as key, adrees is byte offset

heenaa is good girl  0  11
shaikh is maths      11 22


heena 1 
is 1
good 1
girl 1
========================
shaikh 1 
is 1 
maths 1


so we will pass ( 11, heena is goo girl)
(22,shaikh is maths)

=========================================
shuffle do mixing it aggregates the same key values

we need three classes for maprduce
driver  setting all the configuration
mapper
reducer




what is wrapper class uses?
ehat is generics uses?
what is auto boxing and unboxing
             address        text = line    word = text  value = int 
(input key  Longwritable  , input value  text , ouput key  text ,output value  Intwritable)  passed to Mapper class

reducers geting key ie word and list is list of values eg heena,1,1

how to run mapper reducer on integration

hadoop jar wordcount.jar worddriverclassname
