
//Inheritance

//Inheriting parent class by extending it known as inheritance
//child class can use any members of the parent class
//if we extend/inherit abstract class we need to give implementation to all abstract methods
//then only we can use non-abstract methods of abstract class
//we cannot extend/inherit final class
// there are three types of inheritance
//Single inheritance  - only one child class
//Multilevel inheritance - child class has another child class
//Heirarchical inheritance - many child class
//Multiple instructions - multiple parents
