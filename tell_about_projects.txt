I worked on 4 projects

1. Datastage jobs migration to Hadoop for netwatch unit
This project is about keeping records about all the devices in stores.
eg. active divices, non-active devices, most used devices, 
network speed, network status etc.
we import data from oracle using sqoop then
we process data using hive and exported data to teradata inorder to create micro-sttrategy reports

2. Integrated demand and replinishment planning
Sears has its own stores across US, so we keep records 
like which item sold most,
how many quantity of that itemsold,
customer feedback/complaints,
which item sold less,
why it sold less 
and then this inventory data is used for planning and demading items from vendor.
and items are actually replenish to stores/warehouse using rim inventory management

so in IDRP 
we import data from oracle/mysql
then we transform data using Spark SQL using dataframe
then we send data back to oracle


3. Rim - I transformed ruby scripts into Pig
4. Now I am working on Hadoop Scripts Migration to AWS
